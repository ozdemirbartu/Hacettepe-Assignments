I'm Bartu, who is a first year student,probably a lazy one but he is trying his best, and also a self-motivated person.

I acknowledge that I have fully read and understood the contents of the course webiste;I will
not share my work (not even a part of it) on Piazza; I will be responsible for what has been
discussed/asked on Piazza; I will not expect any response for my questions that have already
been asked or written in a language other than English. I understand that if I have any ques-
tions or conserns about the course mechanics, it is my responsibility to discuss them with the
instructors within their office hours.
